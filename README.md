Chess Diagram React Component

![screenshot](./screenshot.PNG)

A react component that can display chess positions from FEN strings or a form of algebraic notation (P@a5 R@h8 etc)

It is almost entirely stateless. (some state is maintained to keep track of mouse / touch events.)

A callback facility is provided to report dragged pieces back to the host application.

to-do: 

ability to flip board (Black's Pov ... )
show side to move
show arrows etc
handle remaining 5 FEN fields etc
